## Purpose of the Script

This script generates an interactive rotating globe, allowing users to explore country geometries 
using `geopandas` and visualize the data with `plotly`. It provides a simple way to visualize geospatial data interactively 
and can be extended for other visualizations involving geographic datasets.

## Steps Followed

1. Created a new directory for the project inside the Git repository.
2. Set up a Python virtual environment using `python -m venv venv`.
3. Activated the virtual environment and installed required dependencies (`geopandas`, `pandas`, `plotly`, `requests`).
4. Generated a full requirements file (`all_requirements.txt`) using `pip freeze`.
5. Cleaned the `requirements.txt` file using `pipdeptree` and `pipreqs` to include only the necessary dependencies.
6. Removed all installed packages to simulate a clean environment.
7. Reinstalled the required dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
8. Verified that the script works as expected by running the interactive globe.
9. Analyzed the projectâ€™s dependencies using `pipdeptree`.
10. Created and documented the process in this `README.md` file.

## Observations or Issues

- During the installation of dependencies, I encountered an issue where some dependencies had conflicting versions. This was resolved by ensuring that all packages were compatible with each other using `pipdeptree`.
- The interactive globe works as expected and it runs very smooth.
- Using `pipreqs` was useful in reducing unnecessary packages in the `requirements.txt` file.
