Static & Dynamic Analysis, Profiling, and Refactoring in Python
📋 Overview
You'll analyze and refactor a Python script using:

✅ Static analysis tools to catch code quality issues
🔍 Line profiling to locate performance bottlenecks
📊 Code coverage tools to detect unused or untested code
You'll then document your fixes in a markdown report and commit each step to GitHub.

🗂️ What to Do
Create a folder in your existing GitHub repo
Copy the provided main.py into the folder.
Begin working from your first commit (the unmodified version).
Use at least 2 static analysis tools (e.g., flake8, pylint, mypy)
Run a line profiler to find bottlenecks and fix them
Run code coverage to identify unused code
Write a brief REPORT.md explaining your process
Push your work and submit a link to the folder (e.g., https://github.com/yourname/yourrepo/tree/main/analysis_refactor_assignment)
