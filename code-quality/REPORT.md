# Static and Dynamic Code Analysis Report

## Static Analysis

**flake8**:
- Line 1: unused import math
- Line 3: unused import random
- Line 21: numbers variable assigned but never used
- Line 22: output variable assigned but never used
- Line 23: Function main is missing a docstring


**pylint**:
- Function slow_func could be simplified
- unused_function never used
- Missing module docstring
- Missing function docstrings for expensive_op, slow_func, and main

**pylint fix rating**:
- before: 6.0/10
- after: 10/10


Bottleneck found in:
- `expensive_op:` Took ~3 seconds for 1000 calls, as the function used a loop to calculate the result.
- `slow_func:` Took 2.7 seconds for 1001 calls

### Fix:
- Replaced loop with arithmetic formula
- Also tested with `lru_cache` â€” significant speedup
- removed unused import
- removed unused variable 'numbers' and replaced it with slow_func()
- Replaced the loop with a mathematical formula, resulting in significant performance improvement.
- No further optimization with lru_cache was performed as the formula provided sufficient optimization.


## Code Coverage

- Coverage before:  ~57%
- Coverage after:  ~100%
- `unused_function()` was not covered, removed

## Fix Summary 

- Static Analysis: Removed unused imports (math and random) and fixed unused variables (numbers, output).
- Refactoring: Rewrote the expensive_op function using a mathematical formula to improve performance.
- Simplification: Simplified the slow_func function using list comprehension instead of manually appending.
- Code Cleanup: Removed dead code (unused_function), and added missing docstrings to the functions and the module.
- Performance: Significant performance improvement was achieved by replacing the loop-based operation with a mathematical formula.
- Static & Dynamic Analysis: Ensured that code passes both static analysis tools (flake8 and pylint) and dynamic profiling.
