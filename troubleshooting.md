# Troubleshooting and Issues
## Issue 1: merge conflict
**Problem**: when trying to merge the 'feature-conflict branch into 'main', I encountered a merge conflict in the 'README.md' file because 
                both branches modified the same part of the file.
**Solution**:  I resolved this conflict by opening the file in my directory and edit. I deleted the line of text that I did not need and just kept             the one i needed, and then deleted the conflic marks <<<, ===, and >>>. 
            this solution fix the conflict.
