 - made a change directly on the main branch.   

Im modifying this file in a new branch to cause a conflict

Summary of what I learned:

I learned how to create a repository, open a repository using git Bash terminal using command "cd <repository name>
I learned how to create a file, edit the file using the command "vim <file name>
I learned what fork is in github, and pull the repository so that I can make changes and then commit
I learned how to use revert to remove an commit that I did not want in my repository.
learned how to push, then always have to commit after pushing.
learned how to collaborate and it was confusing at first but I was able to figure it out.
